A Dynamic Simulation Transformers: Robot to Car Transformation using Code::Blocks(17.12)

--> At first you need to be ready for your Code::Blocks(17.12) using the appropriate Glut library file for a graphical interface to run properly.

--> Create a new project in the Glut file properly and run it. If the first graphical interface runs successfully then copy this project's main.cpp file and paste it on that running main.cpp file and run that.

----- Best of Luck -----
